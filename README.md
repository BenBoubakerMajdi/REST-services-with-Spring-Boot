# REST-services-with-Spring-Boot

In order to finih this Project I followed Spring boot Tutorial in their official website. 
Link to the tutorial: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest
As a beginner Spring boot learner. By following the tutorial step by step and By doing my own researches, I managed to learn these concepts:
- Spring boot folder Structure best practices : Model, Controller, Repository, DTO, Service, Enum, Utils, Config.
- Spring MVC to build web application.
- the JDK(Java Development Kit) includes the JRE(Java Runtime Environment) and develoment tools to run Java code, JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is a part of the JRE and is responsible for executing Java bytecode.
- JSON Serialisation and Deserialization and how the the Jackson library (included in Spring Boot framework) uses the getters and setters in those operations.
- Spring HATEOAS (HAL AS The Engine Of Application State) to create hypermedia Application Language(HAL) and provide Links to the client.
- Spring H2 database is an in-memory database, meaning the data will be loaded automatically inmemory without the need to configure application.properties file to configure the database connection.
- How create hypermedia models by using EntityModelAssembler which implements the RepresentationModelAssembler abstract class.
- What really REST API mean! (Providing the client with JSON payload in the response, Managing POST, PUT, GET, DELETE requests, Creating URLs and CRUD operations,... doesn't make your web-based Application RESTful).
- How to handle exceptions and define a custom exception that extends the RuntimeException interface.
- What's a bean and how Spring framework and the Ioc Container handles them and manahge the Dependency injections.
- How the dependency injection works and its types (Setter, Constructor, Attribute)
- How does the Spring Framework scan all the components and creating Beans when running the appication main file (an error occured when I changed the folder structure of the entire project and Spring wasn't able to detect the components).
- How to make a class's methods and Attributes accessible outside their package or class.
- In order for the Dependency injection to work, annotations like @Component, @Entity, @Service, @Repository... must be written.
- Spring Framework annotations (@RestController, @Configuration, @Bean, @PostMapping, @Entity, @Id...)
- How to use Git in intelliJ IDEA.
